Here are some Heaven Escorts Aruba safety tips for tourists in Aruba:
*Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.
*Don't carry a lot of cash or valuables with you.
*Stick to well-lit areas.
*Let someone know where you're going and when you expect to be back.
*If you do feel unsafe, go to a bar or restaurant that looks busy, or flag down a taxi.
*By following these tips, you can help ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable vacation in Aruba.

Overall, San Nicolas is a safe place to visit during the day. Just be aware of your surroundings at night and avoid the red light district if you can. Enjoy your trip!."
